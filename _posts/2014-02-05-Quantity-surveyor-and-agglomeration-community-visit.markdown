Surveyor Act 1
==============

After a succesful meeting with the advising architect yesterday, I decided to kill two bird in one stone while in town today.  
I had a meeting planned with the quantity surveyor in the afternoon.
The goal was to have a chat with him and discuss the case.
On my side I wanted to know what are the possibilities to split the condominium.
He wanted to have a look around at the site to have a better understanding of my project.
The surveyor understood my points straight away, leaving two ways to deal with the matter:
  - A "right to build"
  - A condominium split
The first option would not be exactlty what I'm looking for, as it allows more rights while remaining inside the curent condominium.
The second option is exactly what i was looking for, as this would be the split of the current condominium into two separate condominia.
The technical solution is as simple as two survey marks.
I was worried about the need of survey the entirety of the building.
That would mean 3 flats, a garage, a hall, and a storage room to survey.
With implication that would go beyond my need and could imply some changes regarding taxes for the other owner in the condo.
As a side note, metering the enclosing walls could be done as a side mission.
I'm now waiting for a cost estimation from the surveyor.
I also have a relative that knows a good surveyor if this one is over priced somehow.

Agglomeration Community Act 3
=============================

I used my time in town to visit the agglo once again.
I had in mind to follow the adving architect reccomandation from the day before.
My goal was talk someone into taking few prints for pre-examination, for the commission that would take place the day after.
That didn't go to plan, yet the outcome was rather positive.
I showed up unanounced at the agglo and ask for the person that stamped the C.U.
She wasn't there, the lady seen in the act 1 was busy, so i ended up a third person from the agglo.

"The more the merrier"
We started by looking at the 1/2000 view of my house in its surroundings that he printed.
A piece that is required in the "Permi de construire" (one thing less to print!).
We then looked at the listed building and building of interest.
The neighboorhood used to be listed.
First good news, as the 1st of Jan 2014, the area has been reduced to 500m surrounding the church, and I'm far from it.
Also both neighboring building are somehow important historicly.
I was lucky, as the my house and the front building are not listed.
Any of those would have required another copy of the files to send to the nationnal architecture body.
That would have add another month to the "permi de construire" to be ready.

That settled, we looked at the other area of restriction, the city restriction.
The area is white listed for car parking, no issue there.
Then the area is classed as "UAB", that comes with other set of restriction, none of which applied to me.
Yet it would be wise for me to have a second look at this ruleset.

We finally looked at what i was really interested into, the structure of the renovation.
While I proudly waved the sketchup prints, we restated the rules that one can use with the current settings.
One wall under 2.5 meters, it will need to go from 2.5 at a 45 degrees angle.
The other side wall, being above 2.5 metters can use a different rule.
We could use it to go with a flat roof, in a straight horisontal fasion.
He added that one could go from the horisontal line until it meets the other line (from 2.5m at 45 degrees)
I settle the matter as the 2.5m from both side as more design merrits to my eyes.

A missing point from the 3D view, was the gutter.
It seems that "Nantaises" and "Chesneau" are the way to go.
Not a really intersting topic, but something important to avoid spending too much time going back and forth at the agglo.

We then went on about openings, windows and line of sight.
The final 3D view will require the windows to be explicit
The "code civil" state in its 875 to 880 articles what are the rules in that space.
Basically, under 2.6m on the neighborring side, I cann have a transparent/see-though, openable, window.
It goes down to 1.9m at the 1rst level (wich didn't strike me as odd, but is odd).
The possibilities are then:
- reinforce, opaque glass as per the legislative text itself.
- glass brick, because it is not considered as openings but more like stone, bricks and other building materials.
The last choice seems like a fit to bring some light in the house from the right hand side.

Another missing feature was the exhaust, ventilation and other pipe that might get out of my house.
They too need to be done in such a way that one will not be able to see though it.
Seems weird at first, but fitting a hat on each pipework should do the trick.
Any pipe where incandecent residu (smoke) get out, need to be 8 metters at least from any opennings in any directions of any neighboors.
That might compromise the dream of a pizza oven, more mesurement to come.
The existing chimney can (and will) be used without issues.

Another missing feature of the 3D prints was the lack of materials.
I will need to explicitly name the materials and their colors.
That will go under the agglo's architech scrutiny.
Hopefully, as i won't go for orange or green, I should be fine.

The expert also told me to join other piece of information in the file.
He ask for a signed proof for the network servitude from the other condo owner.
He added that it would be wise to add it to the house paperwork by the Notarial office.
Same goes for any paper signed by the neighboors if we where to use the shared wall.
This will mitigate any possible legal issues with neighboors in the future.

Another news worth noting is that i will not need a "Permi de construire" as previously though, but a "Déclaration Préalable".
That is an somehow easier licence to obtain.
It also doesn't carry as much legal requirement, notably regaring certification of the finished product.
Less expert to pay in, less time to spend on certification etc...
This is true especially for the "RT 2012" and the thermal certification.
