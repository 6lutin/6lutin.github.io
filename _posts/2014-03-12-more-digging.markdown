Trying to get the crap out of the "floor" turned out to be quite a job.

The floor was made of random planks and pieces of wood on top of beam laid bare on the ground.

It feature anything from slate to gravel and rotten wood.

I also found potery, plates and cutlery.

Also found inside there a turtle shell.
