I added a lot more details into the house now.  
The materials are closer to the end results.  
Also the rooms have been filled.  

The bedroom has cuboards

a whatever it is called

a wardrobe and some cloth hanging capability.

The shower room and toillets are also done.

They will likely need to be swaped to avoid a 100m pipe going through the house in width.

The kitchen made its appearance downstairs, with the pizza oven and its pipe.

So far i only did a reference for the staircase.  
It is too fiddly for me to do it on 3d.  
Ultimatly it will look similar to what equip boats.  
Here is an half accurate of what I mean

That should save up some space and keep the room full of light.

I also started the "cosy room", which will be where we spend evenings.  
So far i only have a sofa and coffee table there, next up is a desk that transform into standing desk.  
I had fun with the gutter too. bonus point if you know where i got the inspiration.
