A House
=======
Here is the story of my house.  
It probably all started with a "Grand Design".  
If not it definitly didn't kill the virus.  
Maybe it was incubating for a while, and grow in me without me noticing it.
Maybe it all started when my dad said that he was getting older. That within 5 years, he would not be able to help me in a house renovation project. 

Fast forward, after a year of looking into it, after a few visits and a missed offer, here we are, at the "Lutin House".  
A 16m2 house, with a 8m2 1rst floor and something along the lines of 200m2 of garden.  
A perfect fit for my budget, a prime location, what could i ask more, I hear you say.  
Well, appart of the stone walls, everything needs to be done, everything.  

Not So Fast
===========
This isn't so much about the house itself.  
This is more about the transformation it is going trough.  
Something to get a trace of my reflection over time.
So before a house and a home, it is a journey, so come onboard



3..2..1..GO
===========
Here is the state it was in when i made my decision.

There is about 4-5 month worth of work.  
Plus there is the legal/planning permission side of things that need to be done too.  
Hopefully, while we wait for the later we can do the can start with the work.  
It is quite difficult to tell anything from the picture as the vegetation is everywhere.

First job: Remove the mimosa's branches

Not to forget a coffee break in between.

The roof also need cleaning up, so the house can breath a bit.

We did quite a fair bit of work today.  
It doesn't look like much, but the light is now able to though.  
Cannot wait to have another go at it.


That's it folks!
