Today I went to work on a staircase's balustrade for a relative
It is not really related to the house, I just tough you would like the picture.

We basically added a safety to avoid poeple to fall over the edge.

One could notice that the openning between the metal bars is quite small (150mm).

Here we can see the vertical guards.
