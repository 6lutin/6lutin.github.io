Meeting With The Advising Architect
===================================

Here is the work I did on (google) sketchup.

It is rough but is enough to give an idea of the completed project volume.

The goal here is only visualise the space, the colors are off.

As an aftertough, the people I put there for size don't provide a great indicator on all picture.
