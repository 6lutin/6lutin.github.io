At some poimt I realised that I needed a new challenge in my life.
As a computer guy, i first belive a new shiny open source project would do.
Or starting a business around a shiny open source project.

It quickly become obvious that it wouldn&#39;t do, I was burned-out.
A while back my dad offered to help me with some house work if I ever needed to. 
I was lacking the skills that people need to do any DYI work around their house.
That was something new and exiting to do.

After a year of looking around, a few missed opportunity and a little luck it was there.
A tiny little house with a bit of garden, all tucked in a green fur.
Not only it was affordable, it was also in the town center with amenities at a stone throw.
I bought it and that&#39;s my current project.
 
I measured things again and again.
I made designs after designs.
I met with the local authorities and their architect to make sure I got the legislation right.
I met with service providers (water, electricity, etc.) to plan connectivity to their network.
I met with suppliers to get the right materials at the right price.
I met with local support group for self-builders.
I met with insurance companies to keep people working on site free of worries. 
Then, all that was left was to start building.
