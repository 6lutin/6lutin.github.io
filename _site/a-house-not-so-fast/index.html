<h1>A House</h1>

<p>Here is the story of my house.<br>
It probably all started with a &quot;Grand Design&quot;.<br>
If not it definitly didn&#39;t kill the virus.<br>
Maybe it was incubating for a while, and grow in me without me noticing it.
Maybe it all started when my dad said that he was getting older. That within 5 years, he would not be able to help me in a house renovation project. </p>

<p>Fast forward, after a year of looking into it, after a few visits and a missed offer, here we are, at the &quot;Lutin House&quot;.<br>
A 16m2 house, with a 8m2 1rst floor and something along the lines of 200m2 of garden.<br>
A perfect fit for my budget, a prime location, what could i ask more, I hear you say.<br>
Well, appart of the stone walls, everything needs to be done, everything.  </p>

<h1>Not So Fast</h1>

<p>This isn&#39;t so much about the house itself.<br>
This is more about the transformation it is going trough.<br>
Something to get a trace of my reflection over time.
So before a house and a home, it is a journey, so come onboard</p>

<h1>3..2..1..GO</h1>

<p>Here is the state it was in when i made my decision.<br>
<img src="/images/2014_01_15_0.jpg" alt="picture"><br>
There is about 4-5 month worth of work.<br>
Plus there is the legal/planning permission side of things that need to be done too.<br>
Hopefully, while we wait for the later we can do the can start with the work.<br>
It is quite difficult to tell anything from the picture as the vegetation is everywhere.<br>
<img src="/images/2014_01_15_1.jpg" alt="picture"><br>
First job: Remove the mimosa&#39;s branches<br>
<img src="/images/2014_01_15_4.jpg" alt="picture"><br>
and other greeneries<br>

Not to forget a coffee break in between.<br>
<img src="/images/2014_01_15_3.jpg" alt="picture"><br>
The roof also need cleaning up, so the house can breath a bit.<br>

<p>We did quite a fair bit of work today.<br>
It doesn&#39;t look like much, but the light is now able to though.<br>
Cannot wait to have another go at it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it folks!</p>
