<p>The sun was out today, perfect opportunity to work on the house.<br>
The main task was to try to get as much root out of the ground as possible.  </p>

<h1>Small Mimosa</h1>

<p>The first one we try our hands on was a small mimosa tree.<br>
I marked a one meter circle around the tree and started to dig.  </p>

<p>It took us about 3 hours and a pitfork to remove this one.<br>

The ground there is a mix of sand, earth and argile.<br>
We will lilkely have to get rid of all of it.<br>
It would be nice to have more earth for the garden.<br>
Hopefully, we will be able to keep what we dig elsewhere.  </p>

<p>This one was full of small roots.<br>
All of them tangled in the much bigger root from the much bigger mimosa tree.<br>

<p>Once done we tackled what was left of the laurel tree.<br>
It had few sizable roots, all going downwards.<br>
It was somehow easier to dig, just earth and stones.<br>
It looked as if the tree was growing in a stone well.<br>
Most of the stones were setup in a circular shape around the tree.<br>
It turned out other wise, no well was actually found.<br>
Still we removed that tree in an hour and a half.<br>

<p>Next up, the massive mimosa roots.<br>
They run far and thick all around the garden.<br>
We have something along the line of 2meter cube to dig still, let&#39;s hope for a lot of sunny days.  </p>
