          <h2>Meeting with the quantity surveyor and visit at the agglomeration community</h2>

<h1>Surveyor Act 1</h1>

<p>After a succesful meeting with the advising architect yesterday, I decided to kill two bird in one stone while in town today.<br>
I had a meeting planned with the quantity surveyor in the afternoon.<br>
The goal was to have a chat with him and discuss the case.<br>
On my side I wanted to know what are the possibilities to split the condominium.<br>
He wanted to have a look around at the site to have a better understanding of my project.<br>
The surveyor understood my points straight away, leaving two ways to deal with the matter:<br>
  - A &quot;right to build&quot;<br>
  - A condominium split<br>
The first option would not be exactlty what I&#39;m looking for, as it allows more rights while remaining inside the curent condominium.<br>
The second option is exactly what i was looking for, as this would be the split of the current condominium into two separate condominia.<br>
The technical solution is as simple as two survey marks.<br>
I was worried about the need of survey the entirety of the building.<br>
That would mean 3 flats, a garage, a hall, and a storage room to survey.<br>
With implication that would go beyond my need and could imply some changes regarding taxes for the other owner in the condominium.<br>
As a side note, metering the enclosing walls could be done as a side mission.<br>
I&#39;m now waiting for a cost estimation from the surveyor.<br>
I also have a relative that knows a good surveyor if this one is overpriced somehow.  </p>

<h1>Agglomeration Community Act 3</h1>

<p>I used my time in town to visit the agglo once again.<br>
I had in mind to follow the advising architect recommandation from the day before.<br>
My goal was to talk someone into taking few prints for the pre-examination, for the commission that would take place the day after.<br>
That didn&#39;t go as planned, yet the outcome was rather positive.<br>
I showed up unanounced at the agglo and ask for the person that stamped the C.U.<br>
She wasn&#39;t there, the lady seen in the act 1 was busy, so i ended up with a third person from the agglo.  </p>

<p>He started off by printing 1/2000 view of my house,one of the pieces that is required in the &quot;Permi de construire&quot; (one thing less to print!).<br>
We then looked at the listed buildings and buildings of the architechtual interest of the area,and it turned out that my neighborhood used to be regulated by the <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecte_des_b%C3%A2timents_de_France">ABF</a>.  </p>

<p>First good news,is that at the 1st of Jan 2014, this area has been reduced to 500m surrounding the St. Christoph church, and I&#39;m far away from it.<br>
Second good news is that my both neighboring buildings are somehow important historicly. It&#39;s really lucky, that I am not, nor is the building in front of me.<br>
Any of those would have required another copy of the files to send to the ABF.<br>
That would have add another month to the &quot;permi de construire&quot; to be ready.  </p>

<p>That settled, we looked at the other area of restrictions, the ones made by the city.<br>
The area is white listed for car parking, no issue there.<br>
Then the area is classed as &quot;UAB&quot;, that comes with other set of restriction, none of which applied to me.<br>
Yet it would be wise for me to have a second look at this ruleset.  </p>

<p>We finally looked at what I was really interested in, the structure of the renovation.<br>
While I proudly waved the sketchup prints, we restated the rules that one can use with the current settings.<br>
The rule is that the roof under 2.5 meters high has to be layed at a 45 degrees angle.<br>
The other side wall, being above 2.5 metters can use a different rule.<br>
We could use it to go with a flat roof, in a straight horisontal fasion.<br>
He added that one could go from the horisontal line until it meets the other line (from 2.5m at 45 degrees)<br>
I settle the matter as the 2.5m from both sides as more design merrits to my eyes.  </p>

<p>A missing point from the 3D view, was the gutter.<br>
It seems that &quot;Nantaises&quot; and &quot;Chesneau&quot; are the way to go.<br>
Not a really intersting topic, but something important to avoid spending too much time going back and forth at the agglo.  </p>

<p>We then went on about openings, windows and line of sight.<br>
The final 3D view will require the windows to be explicit<br>
The &quot;code civil&quot; state in its 875 to 880 articles what are the rules in that area.<br>
Basically, under 2.6m on the neighborring side, I can have a transparent/see-though, openable, window.<br>
It goes down to 1.9m at the 1rst level (wich didn&#39;t strike me as odd, but is odd).<br>
The possibilities are:<br>
- reinforce, opaque glass as per the legislative text itself.<br>
- glass brick, because it is not considered as openings but more like stone, bricks and other building materials.<br>
The last choice seems like a fit to bring some light in the house from the right hand side.  </p>

<p>Another missing feature was the exhaust, ventilation and other pipe that might get out of my house.<br>
They too need to be done in such a way that one will not be able to see through it.<br>
Seems weird at first, but fitting a hat on each pipework should do the trick.<br>
Any pipe where incandecent residu (smoke) get out, need to be  at least 8 metersaway from any opennings in any directions of any neighbours.<br>
That might compromise the dream of the pizza oven, more mesurement to come.<br>
The existing chimney can (and will) be used without issues.  </p>

<p>Another missing feature of the 3D prints was the lack of materials.<br>
I will need to explicitly name the materials and their colors.<br>
That will go under the agglo&#39;s architech scrutiny.<br>
Hopefully, as i won&#39;t go for orange or green, I should be fine.  </p>

<p>The expert also told me to join other pieces of information in the file.<br>
He ask for a signed proof for the network servitude from the other condo owner.<br>
He added that it would be wise to add it to the house paperwork by the Notarial office.<br>
Same goes for any paper signed by the neighboors if we where to use the shared wall.<br>
This will mitigate any possible legal issues with neighboors in the future.  </p>

<p>Another news worth noting is that I will not need a &quot;Permi de construire&quot; as previously though, but a &quot;Déclaration Préalable&quot;.<br>
That is a somehow easier licence to obtain.<br>
It also doesn&#39;t carry as much legal requirement, notably regaring certification of the finished product.<br>
Less expert to pay to, less time to spend on certification etc...<br>
This is true especially for the &quot;RT 2012&quot; and the thermal certification.  </p>
