<p>I added a lot more details into the house now.<br>
The materials are closer to the end results.<br>
Also the rooms have been filled.<br>
The bedroom has cuboards, a wardrobe and some cloth hanging capability.<br>
The shower room and toillets are also done.<br>
They will likely need to be swaped to avoid a 100m going through the house in width.<br>
The kitchen made its appearance downstairs, with the pizza oven and its pipe.<br>
So far i only did a reference for the staircase.<br>
It is too fiddly for me to do it on 3d.<br>
Ultimatly it will look similar to what equip boats.<br>
That should save up some space and keep the room full of light.<br>
I also started the &quot;cosy room&quot;, which will be where we spend evenings.<br>
So far i only have a sofa and coffee table there, next up is a desk that transform into standing desk.<br>
I had fun with the gutter too. bonus point if you know where i got the inspiration.  </p>
