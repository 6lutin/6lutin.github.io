So far i only did a reference for the staircase.<br>
It is too fiddly for me to do it on 3d.<br>
Ultimatly it will look similar to what equip boats.<br>

That should save up some space and keep the room full of light.<br>

I also started the &quot;cosy room&quot;, which will be where we spend evenings.<br>
So far i only have a sofa and coffee table there, next up is a desk that transform into standing desk.<br>
I had fun with the gutter too. bonus point if you know where i got the inspiration.  </p>
